# MySQL Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY

Where JOINS allow you to combine tables, aggregate functions allow you to calculate totals, averages, counts, and other statistical information from your database.

We'll continue using our library management system example with the **Book**, **Author**, and **Genre** tables to demonstrate how aggregate functions work in practice.

## What Are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result. They're called "aggregate" because they combine (aggregate) multiple values into one summary value.

### Common Aggregate Functions

- **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows
- **SUM()**: Adds up all values in a column
- **AVG()**: Calculates the average of values in a column
- **MIN()**: Finds the smallest value in a column
- **MAX()**: Finds the largest value in a column

## Basic Aggregate Function Syntax

The general syntax for aggregate functions is:

```sql
SELECT AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## COUNT() - Counting Records

The `COUNT()` function counts the number of rows that match your criteria.

### Basic COUNT Examples

```sql
-- Count all books in the database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Book;

-- Count all authors
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Author;

-- Count all genres
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Genre;
```

### COUNT with WHERE Conditions

```sql
-- Count books published after 1950
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Book 
WHERE publication_year > 1950;

-- Count authors born after 1900
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Author 
WHERE birth_year > 1900;
```

### COUNT with Specific Columns

```sql
-- Count books that have an ISBN (non-null values)
SELECT COUNT(isbn) FROM Book;

-- Count authors with a bio
SELECT COUNT(bio) FROM Author;
```

**Important**: `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, while `COUNT(column_name)` only counts rows where that column is not NULL.

## SUM() - Adding Values

The `SUM()` function adds up all the values in a numeric column.

### Basic SUM Examples

```sql
-- Calculate total number of pages (if we had a pages column)
-- SELECT SUM(pages) FROM Book;

-- For our current data, let's add a price column to demonstrate
ALTER TABLE Book ADD COLUMN price DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Add some sample prices
UPDATE Book SET price = 12.99 WHERE book_id = 1;
UPDATE Book SET price = 9.99 WHERE book_id = 2;
UPDATE Book SET price = 11.50 WHERE book_id = 3;
UPDATE Book SET price = 8.75 WHERE book_id = 4;
UPDATE Book SET price = 15.99 WHERE book_id = 5;
UPDATE Book SET price = 7.25 WHERE book_id = 6;

-- Now calculate total value of all books
SELECT SUM(price) AS total_value FROM Book;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>total_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>66.47</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### SUM with WHERE Conditions

```sql
-- Calculate total value of books published after 1950
SELECT SUM(price) AS total_value_recent_books
FROM Book 
WHERE publication_year > 1950;
```

## AVG() - Calculating Averages

The `AVG()` function calculates the average of values in a numeric column.

### Basic AVG Examples

```sql
-- Calculate average book price
SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price FROM Book;

-- Calculate average publication year
SELECT AVG(publication_year) AS average_publication_year FROM Book;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>average_price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>11.078333</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### AVG with WHERE Conditions

```sql
-- Calculate average price of books published after 1950
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price_recent_books
FROM Book 
WHERE publication_year > 1950;
```

## MIN() and MAX() - Finding Extremes

The `MIN()` and `MAX()` functions find the smallest and largest values in a column.

### Basic MIN and MAX Examples

```sql
-- Find the cheapest and most expensive books
SELECT 
    MIN(price) AS cheapest_book,
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive_book
FROM Book;

-- Find the oldest and newest publication years
SELECT 
    MIN(publication_year) AS oldest_book,
    MAX(publication_year) AS newest_book
FROM Book;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>cheapest_book</th>
      <th>most_expensive_book</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>7.25</td>
      <td>15.99</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## GROUP BY - Grouping Data

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. This is essential when you want to perform aggregate functions on subsets of your data.

### Basic GROUP BY Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name;
```

### GROUP BY Examples

#### Count Books by Genre

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY book_count DESC;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>genre_name</th>
      <th>book_count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Fantasy</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dystopian Fiction</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Literary Fiction</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mystery</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Science Fiction</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Count Books by Author

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) AS author_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Author a
LEFT JOIN Book b ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
ORDER BY book_count DESC;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>author_name</th>
      <th>book_count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>J.K. Rowling</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>George Orwell</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Harper Lee</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Agatha Christie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virginia Woolf</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Average Price by Genre

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY average_price DESC;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>genre_name</th>
      <th>average_price</th>
      <th>book_count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Fantasy</td>
      <td>14.49</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Literary Fiction</td>
      <td>11.50</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mystery</td>
      <td>8.75</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dystopian Fiction</td>
      <td>8.62</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Science Fiction</td>
      <td>NULL</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## HAVING - Filtering Grouped Results

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after they've been created by `GROUP BY`. It's similar to `WHERE`, but works on grouped data instead of individual rows.

### HAVING Examples

#### Find Genres with More Than 1 Book

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
HAVING COUNT(b.book_id) > 1
ORDER BY book_count DESC;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>genre_name</th>
      <th>book_count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Fantasy</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dystopian Fiction</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Find Authors with Average Book Price Above $10

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) AS author_name,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Author a
INNER JOIN Book b ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
HAVING AVG(b.price) > 10
ORDER BY average_price DESC;
```

## Multiple Aggregate Functions

You can use multiple aggregate functions in the same query to get comprehensive statistics.

### Comprehensive Book Statistics

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_books,
    AVG(price) AS average_price,
    MIN(price) AS cheapest_book,
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive_book,
    SUM(price) AS total_value
FROM Book;
```

**Result:**
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>total_books</th>
      <th>average_price</th>
      <th>cheapest_book</th>
      <th>most_expensive_book</th>
      <th>total_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>11.078333</td>
      <td>7.25</td>
      <td>15.99</td>
      <td>66.47</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Statistics by Genre

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price,
    MIN(b.price) AS cheapest_book,
    MAX(b.price) AS most_expensive_book,
    SUM(b.price) AS total_value
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY book_count DESC;
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Forgetting GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions

**Wrong:**
```sql
SELECT genre_name, COUNT(book_id) FROM Book; -- This will cause an error
```

**Right:**
```sql
SELECT g.genre_name, COUNT(b.book_id) 
FROM Genre g 
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id 
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name;
```

### 2. Using WHERE Instead of HAVING

**Wrong:**
```sql
SELECT genre_name, COUNT(book_id) 
FROM Genre g 
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id 
WHERE COUNT(b.book_id) > 1  -- This won't work
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name;
```

**Right:**
```sql
SELECT genre_name, COUNT(book_id) 
FROM Genre g 
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id 
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
HAVING COUNT(b.book_id) > 1;
```

### 3. Including Non-Aggregated Columns Without GROUP BY

**Wrong:**
```sql
SELECT author_name, COUNT(book_id) FROM Book; -- Missing GROUP BY
```

**Right:**
```sql
SELECT a.author_name, COUNT(b.book_id) 
FROM Author a 
LEFT JOIN Book b ON a.author_id = b.author_id 
GROUP BY a.author_id, a.author_name;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing for GROUP BY

Make sure columns used in GROUP BY are indexed for better performance:

```sql
-- These indexes help with GROUP BY performance
CREATE INDEX idx_book_genre_id ON Book(genre_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_book_author_id ON Book(author_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_book_publication_year ON Book(publication_year);
```

### Efficient GROUP BY Queries

- Use specific column names instead of `SELECT *`
- Include only the columns you need in GROUP BY
- Use appropriate WHERE clauses to filter data before grouping

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Include All Non-Aggregated Columns in GROUP BY

```sql
-- Good: All non-aggregated columns are in GROUP BY
SELECT g.genre_id, g.genre_name, COUNT(b.book_id)
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name;
```

### 2. Use Meaningful Column Aliases

```sql
-- Good: Clear, descriptive aliases
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS total_books,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name;
```

### 3. Order Results Meaningfully

```sql
-- Good: Order by the most relevant column
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY book_count DESC, g.genre_name;
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Library Inventory Report

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS total_books,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price,
    SUM(b.price) AS total_value
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

### Example 2: Genre Popularity Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    g.genre_name,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS total_books,
    AVG(b.price) AS average_price,
    MIN(b.publication_year) AS oldest_book,
    MAX(b.publication_year) AS newest_book,
    SUM(b.price) AS total_genre_value
FROM Genre g
LEFT JOIN Book b ON g.genre_id = b.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.genre_name
ORDER BY total_books DESC, total_genre_value DESC;
```

### Example 3: Publication Year Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN publication_year < 1950 THEN 'Pre-1950'
        WHEN publication_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1999 THEN '1950-1999'
        WHEN publication_year >= 2000 THEN '2000+'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS publication_period,
    COUNT(*) AS book_count,
    AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM Book
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN publication_year < 1950 THEN 'Pre-1950'
        WHEN publication_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1999 THEN '1950-1999'
        WHEN publication_year >= 2000 THEN '2000+'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN publication_year < 1950 THEN 1
        WHEN publication_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1999 THEN 2
        WHEN publication_year >= 2000 THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END;
```

## Summary

Aggregate functions and GROUP BY are essential for data analysis and reporting:

- **COUNT()**: Counts rows or non-null values
- **SUM()**: Adds up numeric values
- **AVG()**: Calculates averages
- **MIN()/MAX()**: Find smallest/largest values
- **GROUP BY**: Groups data for aggregate calculations
- **HAVING**: Filters grouped results

Understanding these functions allows you to create powerful reports and analytics from your database. Combined with JOINs, they enable you to answer complex questions about your data and generate meaningful insights for your web applications.

In the next section, we'll explore how to integrate these SQL skills into your web applications using server-side programming.
