# Chapter 2 - HTML and CSS

[&laquo; Return to the Table of Contents](../index.md)

Now that things are set up, it's time to talk a little bit about HTML and CSS. These subchapters will not go deep into these concepts since this is the web`server` class. But a certain amount of HTML and CSS knowledge will help you understand what sort of information you're frequently providing to the client.

For more information, I highly recommend [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). They have plenty of resources for learning about HTML and CSS tag/style usage.

## HTML and CSS subchapters

### 2. [Basic HTML](htmlTags.md)
