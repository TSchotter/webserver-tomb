# Complex Database Integration

This chapter builds upon the advanced module patterns from Chapter 10 and the SQLite3 database fundamentals from Chapter 9. You'll learn how to create a secure, production-ready authentication system that integrates SQLite3 with your Express server.

## What You'll Learn

- Implementing password encryption using bcrypt
- Creating password validation with minimum requirements
- Building secure user authentication with database-backed login
- Implementing IP-based login attempt tracking and lockout
- Creating modular, reusable authentication components
- Best practices for secure password handling

## Chapter Contents

1. **[Password Requirements and Encryption](password-encryption.md)** - Learn to validate passwords and encrypt them using bcrypt

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, make sure you have:
- Completed [Advanced Module Patterns](../10-nodejs-modules/advanced-modules.md)
- Understanding of [SQLite3 with Node.js Express](../9-sqlite3-server/sqlite3-nodejs-express.md)
- Basic knowledge of [Server-Side Sessions](../7-cookies-sessions/server-side-sessions.md)
- Familiarity with [Middleware Modules](../10-nodejs-modules/middleware-modules.md)

## Quick Start

Start with [Password Requirements and Encryption](password-encryption.md) to learn the fundamentals of secure password handling, then proceed through each subchapter to build a complete authentication system.
