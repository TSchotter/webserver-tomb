First, we need to get you connected to the server. First through just the terminal to make sure your account is available, then through VSCode.

## Setup Steps

### 1. [Accessing Server](accessingServer.md)
Learn how to connect to the remote server using SSH from your terminal. This includes getting your account credentials, verifying your account page exists, and establishing your first connection to the server.

### 2. [Basic Linux Navigation](linuxNavigation.md)
Master essential Linux commands for navigating the file system, managing files, and communicating with other users on the server. Includes file operations, directory navigation, and terminal communication tools.

### 3. [VSCode Extension](vsCodeConnection.md)
Set up VSCode with the Remote SSH extension to connect to the server directly from your IDE. This allows you to edit files, use the integrated terminal, and work seamlessly with your remote development environment.
